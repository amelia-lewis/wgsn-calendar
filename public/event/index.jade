                h3 Description
                p What with the rise of androgynous dressing, the frequently blurring boundaries of gender, and the popularity of grungy street-inspired brands like Vetements, it’s no surprise that a key exhibition for Spring focuses on the notion of dress code and ‘garment scandal’, and how this perhaps transgressive design movement has led to a pivotal moment in fashion today.
                p View over 400 articles of clothing, accessories, portraits, and objects which question dress codes and moral values - including but not limited to, skirts for men, tuxedos for women, baggy jeans, and more - with the exhibition split into three themes: ‘clothing and rule’, ‘is it a boy or a girl’, and ‘provocative excesses’.
